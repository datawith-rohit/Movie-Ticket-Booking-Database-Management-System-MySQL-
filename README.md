- Created normalized tables using DDL and enforced relationships using primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints to maintain data integrity. 
- Performed extensive data manipulation using INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, TRUNCATE, and DROP commands for real-time data handling. 
- Developed 50+ analytical SQL queries using JOINs, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY, LIMIT, DISTINCT, and WHERE to derive insights like top customers, popular movies, and theater revenue.
